# Wifi-Test
Test if WiFi card(airport) turns off at any moment during a period of 24hrs. Script is already setup as an executable.  

In order for the script to run you must do two things:
1. Name of user needs to be the same as the script so either name user as it is written in the script "test" or edit the script to have the same user name as what you already have. 
2. Give Terminal access to full disk in Settings>Privacy & Security>Full Disk Access

Once those two conditions have been met double click on the script which should already be set as executable.
