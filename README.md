# Wifi-Test
Test if WiFi card(airport) turns off at any moment during a period of 24hrs. Script is already setup as an executable.  

In order for the script to run you must do the following:

1. Name of Volume and User needs to be the same as the script so either name Volume and User as it is written in the script "Macintosh HD" & "test" or edit the script to have the same Volume and User name as what you already have in your system. 

2. Give Terminal access to full disk in Settings>Privacy & Security>Full Disk Access

3. Depending on the macOS version, ex. Ventura and above, you may need to change the permission of the script by opening Terminal and typing "sudo chmod +x (_file path_)".

Once those conditions have been met double click on the script to run it.
